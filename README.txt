# Restaurant Data Analysis – Cognifyz Technologies Internship Project

## 🎯 Objective
To analyze a dataset of 9,500+ restaurant records and generate insights into cuisines, city-level performance, pricing, ratings, and customer preferences using both Python and Excel.

## 📂 Dataset
- Rows: 9,551
- Columns: 21
- Key fields: Restaurant Name, City, Cuisines, Price range, Aggregate rating, Votes, Online Delivery, Table Booking, Latitude/Longitude.

## ✅ Tasks Completed

### Level 1
1. **Top Cuisines** – Identified top 3 cuisines (North Indian, Chinese, Fast Food) with their share of restaurants.
2. **City Analysis** – Found city with highest number of restaurants (New Delhi) and city with highest avg. rating (Inner City).
3. **Price Range Distribution** – Visualized price ranges and % distribution across restaurants.
4. **Online Delivery** – Compared ratings of restaurants with vs. without online delivery.

### Level 2
1. **Cuisine Combinations** – Analyzed most popular cuisine pairs (North Indian + Chinese, etc.).
2. **Geographic Analysis** – Explored restaurant clustering using latitude/longitude data.
3. **Restaurant Chains** – Identified chains and analyzed their ratings/popularity.
4. **Reviews** – Summarized review categories (Excellent, Very Good, Poor, etc.).

### Level 3
1. **Votes Analysis** – Found restaurants with highest and lowest votes; analyzed correlation with ratings.
2. **Price vs. Delivery & Booking** – Studied relation between price range and service availability.

## 📊 Tools & Technologies
- **Python**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn (Data cleaning, EDA, analysis).
- **Excel**: Pivot Tables, Charts (Visualization & reporting).
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For reproducible workflow and insights documentation.

## 📈 Key Insights
- 41% of restaurants serve **North Indian cuisine**, followed by Chinese (28%) and Fast Food (20%).
- **New Delhi** has the highest number of restaurants, while **Inner City** has the highest average rating (4.9).
- Restaurants offering **online delivery** have slightly higher ratings on average.
